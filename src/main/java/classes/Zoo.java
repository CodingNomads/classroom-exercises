/**
 * Lets use classes to model the real world (Object oriented programming!!!)
 * <p>
 * This class represents the a Zoo. Its where you will be creating new instances of your other classes and use them.
 * <p>
 * 1: Create another class that represents a place of a Zoo, for example, MonkeyCage.
 * 2: Create another class that represents the animals that go into that place, for example, Animal.
 * 3: Create another class that represents a recipient for the food of the animals, for example, FoodBasket.
 * 4: Create another class that represents the food inside the recipients, for example, Food
 * <p>
 * Based on the example the previous classes should:
 * - The MonkeyCage contains Monkeys
 * - The Animal eats bananas. (Create a method in Animal that accepts a Food)
 * - When a Food is retrieved from the FoodBasket, the amount of Bananas in FoodBasket should decrease by 1.
 * <p>
 * Try to create more variables and more methods in those classes that represents more real world actions and properties
 * NOTE: All the classes should be in their own file.
